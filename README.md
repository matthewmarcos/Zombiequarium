# Zombiequarium
A crazy, zombie-themed aquarium game! Buy new fishes, feed your fishes, and collect as many coins as you can!

## Gameplay
The game begins with two fish (hatchling) swimming around the aquarium. Every after 20-30 seconds, it breathes out a coin (1 unit).

The coin can be picked up by the player by clicking it. The picked up coin is added to the total coins the player has. The coins can be used to purchase additional fish at the price of 20 coins. After purchasing the fish it will join the other fish in the aquarium as a hatchling. A hatchling matures into a juvenile after 40-60 seconds. A juvenile produces a coin (3 units) at the same rate as a hatchling. A juvenile matures into an adult after 40-60 seconds. An adult produces a coin (5 units) at the same rate as a hatchling.

The player needs to feed the fish by clicking into an area in the aquarium; otherwise, the fish dies after 30-40 seconds without eating. The nearest fish will eat the food dropped by the player regardless of whether it is hungry or not. The color of the fish changes 8 seconds before it dies.
The food pellet will sink at the bottom; once it reaches the bottom, the pellet disappears.

The player can purchase more food using the collected coins at the price of 25 coins per bag (25 pellets).

The player has an initial 1 bag of food.

The game goes on for 5 minutes. The number of coins collected by the player will be his score. The game keeps track of the five different players with the highest scores.
